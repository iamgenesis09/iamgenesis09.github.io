excerpt: "Beginner Ethical Hacker | Sharing TryHackMe writeups & learning notes"
---

Hi, I'm Rahul (RY aka iamgenesis09) from Gandhinagar, Gujarat.

Currently diving deep into ethical hacking, cybersecurity fundamentals, and offensive security through platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and VulnHub.

**What I focus on:**
- Linux & Windows Privilege Escalation
- Web Exploitation (SQLi, XSS, File Inclusion, etc.)
- Network Pentesting & Forensics
- CTF writeups & tool usage notes

This blog is my personal notebook – writeups, cheatsheets, and lessons learned.  
Feel free to connect on GitHub or Twitter!

If you're also starting out, let's learn together. 🚀
